## Fill in the blank example

This is an example of the fill in the blank question type

I like ___(/^rubber ducks$/i)[regex: 1, width: 250px] - This is a regex response

They are ___(yellow)[] - What color are they?

And they're still ___(Yellow)[case sensitive: 1, width:100px], but case sensitive this time
